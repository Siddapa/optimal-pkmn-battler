# Contributing

Please read through the [README](../README.md), [docs](../docs), and
[pkmn.cc/@pkmn](https://pkmn.cc/@pkmn/) for general information about the pkmn engine and about
development on `@pkmn` projects respectively. The pkmn engine Zig code loosely adheres to the [style
guidelines outlined by
TigerBeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md), whereas
the TypeScript code follows the usual [`@pkmn` style](https://pkmn.cc/@pkmn/#style). When opening
issues or pull requests, please use one of the existing templates and fill them out to the best of
your ability. Pull requests are unlikely to be merged without tests, but it's fine to open a pull
request without tests for feedback or to ask for help with testing. :)

The best way to help contribute to the pkmn engine is actually to contribute to the upstream
projects that the engine depends on - fixing bugs/simplifying
[smogon/pokemon-showdown](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown) or improving/clarifying the
[pret](https://github.com/pret) decompilations are the highest impact ways to benefit not just the
engine but the larger Pok√©mon development community.
